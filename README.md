# MMTC - Myanmar Maid Training Centre
#### This project is to enhance the maid agency business, by engaging some AI chatbot, and I have trained the chatbot with some knowledge.
#### This can ease our workload on repetitive question and we can train the bot with a standard answer to improve on the business efficiency.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Design Process
#### We mainly use bootstrap 5 as our main CSS to style the website. And some customised CSS to fine tune on certain elements.
#### The main idea is to let user know how to direct hire themself, if any question, they can ask the AI-Bot.
#### We use very lightly theme tone on the color to have a easy feel and look on the website.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Feature
#### The main feature of this website is to teach the potential employer to hire the maid/helper themselves.
#### With the help of AI-bot, and the guide I put in place, they can do it easily.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Additional Feature in future
#### We have plan to integrate a database and enable direct matching based on user requirements. And AI-bot recommendation.
